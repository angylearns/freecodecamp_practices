// The "Profile Lookup" practice from the Basic JavaScript section of the freeCodeCamp's JavaScript 
// Algorithms and Data Structures certificate.

// Intructions:
// We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts lists.
// A lookUpProfile function that takes name and a property (prop) as arguments has been pre-written for you.
// The function should check if name is an actual contact's firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.
// If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.
// If name does not correspond to any contacts then return the string No such contact.
// If prop does not correspond to any valid properties of a contact found to match name then return the string No such property.

// Setup
const contacts = [
    {
      firstName: "Akira",
      lastName: "Laine",
      number: "0543236543",
      likes: ["Pizza", "Coding", "Brownie Points"],
    },
    {
      firstName: "Harry",
      lastName: "Potter",
      number: "0994372684",
      likes: ["Hogwarts", "Magic", "Hagrid"],
    },
    {
      firstName: "Sherlock",
      lastName: "Holmes",
      number: "0487345643",
      likes: ["Intriguing Cases", "Violin"],
    },
    {
      firstName: "Kristian",
      lastName: "Vos",
      number: "unknown",
      likes: ["JavaScript", "Gaming", "Foxes"],
    },
  ];
  
function lookUpProfile(name, prop) {
// Only change code below this line
for (let i = 0; i < contacts.length; i++) {
        if (contacts[i].firstName === name) {
            if (contacts[i].hasOwnProperty(prop)) { // It can also be 'if (prop in contacts[i])'
                return contacts[i][prop];
            } else {
                return "No such property";
            }
        }
    }
    return "No such contact";
// Only change code above this line
}
  
lookUpProfile("Akira", "likes");

// Explanation of the part of the code I didn't understand (as I had to refer to the solution when I was ALMOST there):
// If the firstName parameter isnâ€™t matched by the final contacts object, the for loop exits and No such contact is returned.
